# An Accurate EEGNet-based Motor-Imagery Brain--Computer Interface for Low-Power Edge Computing

In this repository, we share the code for classifying MI data of the Physionet EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset using EEGNet. 
For details, please refer to the papers below.

#### Installing Dependencies
You will need a machine with a CUDA-enabled GPU and the Nvidia SDK installed to compile the CUDA kernels.
Further, we have used conda as a python package manager and exported the environment specifications to `dependency.yml`. 
You can recreate our environment by running 

```
conda env create -f dependency.yml -n mybciEnv 
```
Make sure to activate the environment before running any code. 

#### Download Physionet Dataset
EEGNet: 
Download the `.edf` files of the Physionet EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset [here](https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/), unpack it, and put into the folder `dataset/`

#### Train and Validate Global and Subject-specific Models
Global models are trained and validated in `main_global.py`. Results are in `results/your-global-experiment/stats` and global models in `results/your-experiment-name/model`. 
```
python3 main_global.py
```

After having trained and stored the global model, they can be refined by doing subject-specific transfer learning (SS-TL) using `main_ss.py`. 
```
python3 main_ss.py
```
#### Plots
