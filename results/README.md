## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter search was done for three different parameters: 
* Learning Rate
* Dropout Rate
* Number of Epochs

## Global Models
Global classifier models were trained for 2-, 3-, and 4-class data:
* 5-Fold Cross-Validation Accuracy
* 5-Fold Cross-Validation Loss
* Confusion Matrices

## Subject Specific
Global classifier models were further retrained on individual subject data
for 2-, 3-, and 4-class data
* Per Subject 4-Fold Cross-Validation Accuracy/Loss
* Averaged among source global model 4-Fold CV Accuracy/Loss
* Averaged among all subjects 4-Fold CV Accuracy/Loss
